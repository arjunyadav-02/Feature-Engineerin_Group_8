# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises labeled tweets indicating whether they are positive or negative. The project involves exploratory data analysis, text preprocessing, and building machine learning models to predict sentiment.

## Dataset

- The dataset consists of two files: `train_tweet.csv` for training and `test_tweets.csv` for testing.
- Check for any missing values in both datasets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Explore the distribution of positive and negative tweets using bar plots.
- Analyze the length of tweets and visualize the variations.

## Word Analysis

- Use CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical format.
- Explore the most frequently occurring words in the dataset through bar plots and word clouds.
- Collect and analyze hashtags from tweets.

## Word Embeddings

- Utilize Word2Vec to create word embeddings for the tweets.
- Explore word similarities using Word2Vec.

## Text Preprocessing

- Tokenize and preprocess the text data by removing stopwords, stemming, and creating a bag of words.

## Machine Learning Models

- Use various machine learning models such as RandomForest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree for sentiment prediction.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

## File Structure

- `train_tweet.csv`: Training dataset
- `test_tweets.csv`: Testing dataset
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions
- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code
- `wordclouds/`: Directory containing generated word cloud images

## Instructions

1. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` for detailed code execution.
3. Explore the generated word cloud images in the `wordclouds/` directory.
